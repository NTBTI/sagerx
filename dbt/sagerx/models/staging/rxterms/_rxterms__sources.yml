              To flag drug names deemed not likely to be useful for data entry. 
              For example, long generic drug names with multiple ingredients (e.g. Bacitracin/Hydrocortisone/Neomycin/Polymyxin B) are suppressed because they are almost always prescribed by their brand names (e.g. CORTISPORIN OINTMENT). 
              Any non-null value means that a row should be suppressed.
